# Code Challenge: Interactive Shopping List

This challenge combines array iteration, DOM manipulation, and event handling to create an interactive shopping list application.

## Objective
Develop a webpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## Requirements
- **Array**: Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.
- **DOM Manipulation**:
  - Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
  - Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button (items do not persist after page refresh).
  - Update the visual representation of list items to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).
- **Event Handling**:
  - Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
  - Attach event listeners to the list items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
  - Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.
